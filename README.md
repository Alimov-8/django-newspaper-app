 ### ðŸ“š Build websites with Python & Django (WILLIAM S. VINCENT)
    - Conclusion:
    Weâ€™ve now built five different web applications from scratch 
    and covered all the major features of Django:
    templates, views, urls, users, models, security, testing, 
    and deployment + CRUD functionality. Now I have the
    knowledge to go off and build my own modern websites with Django.
